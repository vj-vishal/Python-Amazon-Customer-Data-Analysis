# Python-Amazon-Customer-Data-Analysis
# Project Summary: Analyzing Amazon Customer Data
Objective: The aim of this project was to analyze Amazon customer behavior by exploring various aspects of customer interactions, product reviews, and engagement patterns. Using Python and SQLite, I was able to uncover insights related to product recommendations, review volumes, customer behavior, and sentiment analysis to help businesses optimize their customer experience and product offerings
## 1. Data Collection and Preparation: 
The data for this analysis was sourced from an SQLite database containing Amazon customer interactions, including product reviews, user behaviors, and product details. The data preparation process involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, ensuring it was free from missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis.

## 2. Identifying Duplicate Instances: 
One of the first steps was to check for duplicate rows in the dataset. This was essential to ensure that our analysis wasn't skewed by repeated entries. Using Python, duplicate instances were identified and removed, leaving a clean dataset for further analysis.

## 3. User-Based Product Recommendations: 
To determine which products Amazon can recommend to users, I analyzed purchasing and review behaviors. By identifying patterns in product preferences among users, I was able to provide insights into which products are more likely to appeal to certain user demographics. This is valuable for improving personalized recommendation systems.

## 4. Products with the Most Reviews:
I performed an analysis to determine which products had the highest number of customer reviews. These products can be considered as the most popular or most engaging, potentially reflecting higher levels of customer satisfaction or controversy. This analysis could inform decisions around inventory and product promotions.

## 5. Behavior of Frequent vs. Non-Frequent Viewers: 
A key part of the project was comparing the behavior of frequent viewers versus non-frequent viewers. By examining how often users interact with products and the type of products they view, I found significant behavioral differences. Frequent viewers tended to engage more with niche products, while non-frequent viewers gravitated toward mainstream, popular items.

## 6. Verbosity of Frequent Users: 
An interesting aspect of the analysis was determining whether frequent users tend to be more verbose in their reviews. The data revealed that frequent users, who engage regularly with Amazon, often write longer, more detailed reviews. This suggests that more active users are more likely to share in-depth feedback about their experiences with products, providing valuable insights for both customers and businesses.

## 7. Sentiment Analysis of Reviews: 
To gain insights into customer satisfaction, I conducted sentiment analysis on product reviews. The results showed a mix of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, which can be used to understand customer feelings toward specific products. By analyzing these sentiments, businesses can gauge customer reactions, identify areas of improvement, and tailor their marketing strategies.

## Conclusion:
This analysis provided valuable insights into the purchasing and review behavior of Amazon users, which can be leveraged to improve personalized product recommendations, marketing strategies, and overall customer experience. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding customer sentiment and engagement patterns, which can help businesses better serve their customers and improve their products and services
